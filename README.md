# Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson
### **Author : Cognitive Class AI**

## Introduction
Welcome to this guided project about creating a voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. The guided project takes you through building a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. The voice assistant will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.

## Objectives
- Understand the basics of voice assistants and their various applications
- Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Implement speech-to-text functionality to allow the assistant to understand voice input from users
- Integrate the assistant with OpenAI’s GPT-3 model to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests
- Implement text-to-speech functionality to allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice output
- Combine all of the above components to create a functioning assistant that can take voice input and provide a spoken response
- (Optional) Understand how to deploy the assistant to a web server for use by a wider audience

## Prerequisites
Having knowledge of the basics of HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python are nice to have but not essential. We will do our best in explaining each step of the process as well as any code shown along the way.
